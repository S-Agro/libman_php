This is the reader's manual for using and editing this software project as you may like.

----------------------------------------------

Prerequisites before using this software :

1. Make sure you have a web server environment correctly setup on your local/remote machine.
2. XAMPP is the recommended Apache and MySQL distribuition tested to be working with the project.
3. Make sure you import MySQL database from "database_backup" folder into your MySQL server installation before starting to use the website.

----------------------------------------------

Short Introduction :

This is a website project which focuses on functions regarding inventory management of a library as well as the students/librarians and teachers dealing with the setup. There is also a superadmin panel which can be accessed to manipulate the credentials of the users as well as managing the list.

The basic functions include :
- Librarian management who access the system
- Teacher and student list management
- Book inventory management
- Return/Issue of the books (Incomplete in this version)

----------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTE :

You can use the username "administrator" and password "adminpass" to login to the super-admin panel for the first time.
From there, you can create/manage new accounts to work upon.

Also, allow the popups to run on the site (if your browser blocks them) as the operations would be impossible without the JS popups which achieve the functionality. The site wouldnt work correctly without allowing the popups to arrive.

You can also edit the SQL server address and credentials in the connection objects on respective pages if they are different for your setup.

----------------------------------------------

STEPS TO RUN:

After the putting the complete folder into the htdocs of your webserver installation, open "home.php" to begin with.

----------------------------------------------

Note for the Developers : 

home.php is the entry point of the website.

Names of all the pages and popups are self explanatory and can be edited as you like.

----------------------------------------------

You can complete the "issue_book.php","return_book.php" as well as "view_log.php" to complete the described functionality of book issue/return operations. Your ideas would be really appreciated by the author of this project, aka the owner of this repository.
